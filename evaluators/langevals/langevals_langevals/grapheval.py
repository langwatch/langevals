Important Tips
                        1. Make sure all information is included in the knowledge graph .
                        2. Each triple must only contain three strings ! None of the strings should be empty .
                        3. Do not split up related information into separate triples because this could change the meaning. 
                        4. Make sure all brackets and quotation marks are matched .
                        5. Before adding a triple to the knowledge graph, checkn the concatenated triple makes sense as a sentence. If not, discard it.
