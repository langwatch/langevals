Welcome to LangWatch, the all-in-one [open-source](https://github.com/langwatch/langwatch) LLMops platform.

LangWatch allows you to track, monitor, guardrail and evaluate your LLMs apps for measuring quality and alert on issues.

For domain experts, it allows you to easily sift through conversations, see topics being discussed and annotate and score messages
for improvement in a collaborative manner with the development team.

For developers, it allows you to debug, build datasets, prompt engineer on the playground and
run batch evaluations or [DSPy experiments](./dspy-visualization/quickstart) to continuously improve the product.

Finally, for the business, it allows you to track conversation metrics and give full user and quality analytics, cost tracking, build
custom dashboards and even integrate it back on your own platform for reporting to your customers.

You can [sign up](https://app.langwatch.ai/) and already start the integration on our free tier by following the guides bellow:
